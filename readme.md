# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent Calendar of small programming puzzles.

The 2023 solutions are written in TypeScript and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is used to run and test. The 2022 solutions were written in JavaScript and run with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

I have included my inputs and snapshots of the answers. You will need to save your own puzzle input provided on the website to `input.txt` and run the tests. and the results will be logged to the console.

For example:

```sh
bun test -t sample # Run all tests with "sample" in the name
bun test 2023/01 # Run all the tests for the first puzzle for 2023
bun test 2023/01/part1 # Run all the tests for part 1 of the first puzzle for 2023
bun test --update-snapshots # Update all the result shapshots
bun test --coverage # Run all the tests and show the test coverage
```
